          <b>So, what is noise-induced hearing loss?</b> <br><br> Noise-induced hearing loss is hearing loss 
          caused by regular or lengthy exposure to sounds over 85 decibels. It can also be caused by 
          one-time exposures to noises over 120 decibels.  <br><br> So, what does NIHL look and sound like? 
          <br><br> <b>Noise-Induced Hearing Loss can lead to:</b>
          <li> tinnitus, ringing in the ears</li>
          <li> sharp pain or aches in the ears</li>
          <li> muffled or distorted sounds</li>
          <li> trouble diffrentiating speech consonants (eg. 'p' and 't') </li>
          <li> trouble hearing high pitched noises </li>
          <li> hypersensitivity to certain noises </li><br>
          <b>Who is most at risk?</b> <br>
          The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 12.5% of children aged 6-19 years (approx. 5.2 million) 
          and 17% of adults aged 20-69 years (approx. 26 million) have impared hearing due to NIHL. Some factors that
          play into the risk of NIHL include genetic factors, diseases, drugs + medications, aging, trauma, and tumors.
          As such, people aged 60-69 tend to be at a higher risk of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss.
          <br><br>
          <b>Am I at risk?</b> <br>
          Yes. Everyone is at risk of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss, but those consistantly dealing with loud noises are most at risk.
          Some examples include construction workers, band musicians, and people who consistantly listen to loud music. It has even been 
          found that some childrens toys are loud enough to cause permanent damage to small childrens ears.
          <br><br>
          <b>How do I avoid contracting Noise-Induced Hearing Loss?</b> <br><br> Be aware of how loud your
          surroundings are, and try to keep your exposure to loud sounds to a minimum. If your job
          requires you to work in a noisy enviroment, make sure you have the appropriate gear to
          protect you from the loud noises. Try to move away from the sources of those loud noises
          if possible. When using earbuds or headphones, make sure you limit your volume and take
          regular breaks.

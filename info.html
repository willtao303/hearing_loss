          <body><b>How do I avoid contracting Noise-Induced Hearing Loss?</b> <br><br> Be aware of how loud your
          surroundings are, and try to keep your exposure to loud sounds to a minimum. If your job
          requires you to work in a noisy enviroment, make sure you have the appropriate gear to
          protect you from the loud noises. Try to move away from the sources of those loud noises
          if possible. When using earbuds or headphones, make sure you limit your volume and take
          regular breaks.</body>
